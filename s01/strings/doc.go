/*
Package strings contains test functions for various exercises related to strings.
Please read test function documentation for the problem definitions, examples and
testing.

During last few lessons we've touched very important data structures - arrays [1]
and slices [2,3,4]. One particular types of slices stands out a lot -- read-only
slice of bytes aka string [5].

I would highly recommend to go through "Strings, bytes, runes and characters in
Go" [5] -- a blog post from one of the Golang and UTF-8 [6] creators Rob Pike.
The blog post contains lots of executable examples and exercises that you can
perform while reading through the article.

Optionally, if want to learn more about multilingual text processing, there is
another nice blog post [7] available, which focuses on text normalization. But
please note that this is an advance topic that we are not going to cover any soon.

Please note that there are many exercises that have their implementations in
the standard `strings` package. We would like to ensure that you create your own
implementation!
